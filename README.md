## About  
TypeSmart is a **chill typing webapp** that helps you practice typing with your **own content**.  
Instead of random filler texts, you can upload your own notes, book excerpts, or research material, make groups, organize everything in your library and type in a **minimal, distraction-free interface**.  

With two modes available:  
- **Main** → Full version, requires authentication (Google Sign-In).  
- **Demo** → Fully working demo, no sign-in required.

## Why I Built It  
Most typing apps focus only on speed and leaderboards.  

I wanted something calmer:  
- A way to **grow smarter without even tyring**.  
- A space where typing practice feels **useful and stress-free**.  
- A tool that helps me **learn subconsciously**, just by typing.

## Features  
- ✍️ Add new texts from anywhere (with file/PDF reference support).

- 🎯 Smart generation — important texts appear more often.

- 🚀 Demo mode (no login required).  
- 🎨 5 beautiful dark themes (inspired by Monkeytype).
